<h1>War-Cards-Game</h1>
<h3>It is a cards game based on the concept of War built using Object Oriented Programming in Python.</h3>

<h1>WELCOME TO YOUR OOP PROJECT</h3>

For this project you will be using OOP to create a card game. This card game will
be the card game "War" for two players, you an the computer. If you don't know
how to play "War" here are the basic rules:
The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time,
face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places his stack of cards face down,
in front of him.
The Play:
Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card
takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.
If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up three cards face
down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles
(six cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places
another card face down and turns another card face up. The player with the
higher card takes all 10 cards, and so on.
There are some more variations on this but we will keep it simple for now.
Ignore "double" wars
